    <title>#throwback #onthisday - before tiktok came about i was (and still am) a professional dancer so my content was wayyy more polished - it was common for creatives to produce their own concept videos to showcase yourself, like this choreography concept video </title>

    <content>#throwback #onthisday - before tiktok came about i was (and still am) a professional dancer so my content was wayyy more polished - it was common for creatives to produce their own concept videos to showcase yourself, like this choreography concept video of disco jazz vibes above (full vid on youtube) i had so many ideas i wanted to exectue but the time and ebery it took was always discouraging. This took hours of rehearsal and filming and editing for lots of people and i spent a lot on studio rentals and crew and lunches - all that just for a video that no one asked for. BUT THEN when i began tiktokking and uploading my raw unpolished ideas, i saw the response and was blown away at how easy it was to produce work without any production! So I immediately switched to a low-fi execution and was able to consistently push out my constant flow of ideas! And that was life changing. </content>
